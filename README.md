# Genesis Node · Design & Build System (Node.js v23.7.0)

The goal of this document is to capture how the Node.js v23.7.0 stack in this repository is designed, how it is built, and the tooling expectations for contributors. It focuses on the backend NestJS service that lives in `./backend` and highlights the Node 23.7–specific nuances you need to be aware of when developing or deploying.

## Quick facts

- **Runtime:** Node.js v23.7.0 (Current release line)
- **Package manager:** `pnpm` (managed through Node Corepack)
- **Framework:** NestJS 11 on top of TypeScript 5.7
- **Testing:** Jest 30 with Supertest for e2e coverage
- **Linting & formatting:** ESLint 9 + Prettier 3

```

At the moment the project exposes a single NestJS application. Future services or clients can live alongside `backend/` and consume the same Node 23.7 toolchain.

## System architecture

### High-level flow

```
HTTP request → NestJS Controller → Service layer → Response DTO → HTTP response
```

- **Entry point:** `backend/src/main.ts` bootstraps the Nest application using `AppModule`.
- **Controllers:** handle transport concerns (routing, validation) and delegate to services.
- **Services:** encapsulate domain logic and can later depend on repositories or external providers.
- **Dependency injection:** Nest’s IoC container wires controllers, services, and any providers you declare inside modules.
- **Modules:** `AppModule` is the current root module; add feature modules as functionality grows to keep boundaries clear.

### Configuration & environment

- Use Node 23.7’s native `.env` loading via libraries such as `@nestjs/config` when configuration needs arise.
- Split environment variables into profiles (`.env.local`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`) once secrets or per-environment values are required.
- Prefer typed configuration objects to keep parity with TypeScript’s compile-time guarantees.

### Future expansion guidelines

- Introduce `DomainModule`s (e.g., `UsersModule`, `AuthModule`) to maintain a clean modular architecture.
- Wrap external integrations (databases, queues, third-party APIs) behind provider tokens to preserve testability.
- Use Nest’s pipes, filters, and interceptors for cross-cutting concerns (validation, error mapping, logging, caching).

## Build & tooling pipeline

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v23.7.0** – install via `nvm install 23.7.0` (or your preferred version manager).
- **Corepack** – ships with Node 23; enable it with `corepack enable` to pin `pnpm` versions per project.
- **pnpm** – automatically provisioned once Corepack is enabled (`corepack use pnpm@latest` if needed).
- **Optional tools:** Docker (for container builds), VS Code + NestJS/TypeScript extensions for best DX.

### Installation

```bash
# enable Corepack once per machine
corepack enable

# ensure the runtime matches the project target
node --version  # should print v23.7.0

# install dependencies from the repository root
cd backend
pnpm install
```

### Build stages

1. **TypeScript compile:** `pnpm run build` invokes the Nest CLI which transpiles `src/**/*.ts` using `tsconfig.build.json`, emitting artifacts into `dist/`.
2. **Bundled assets (optional):** For advanced scenarios you can enable SWC or webpack via Nest CLI configuration – not needed for the current footprint.
3. **Runtime launch:** `pnpm run start:prod` executes `node dist/main.js` on Node 23.7 in production mode.

### Toolchain summary

| Stage              | Command                     | Notes |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----- |
| Format             | `pnpm run format`           | Prettier 3.4 with project-internal rules.
| Lint               | `pnpm run lint`             | ESLint 9 + `typescript-eslint` v8; auto-fix enabled by default flag.
| Build              | `pnpm run build`            | Uses Nest CLI with incremental TypeScript compilation.
| Start (dev)        | `pnpm run start:dev`        | Leverages Nest’s hot reload + Node 23 watch mode.
| Start (prod)       | `pnpm run start:prod`       | Runs compiled output with `node dist/main`.
| Unit tests         | `pnpm run test`             | Jest 30 in single-run mode.
| Watch tests        | `pnpm run test:watch`       | Useful for TDD loops.
| e2e tests          | `pnpm run test:e2e`         | Bootstraps app against Supertest harness.

## Local development workflow

1. **Install dependencies** – see [Installation](#installation).
2. **Start the dev server** – run `pnpm run start:dev` to boot Nest in watch mode; Node 23.7’s file system watcher keeps restarts responsive even on large codebases.
3. **Code with confidence** – rely on TypeScript’s strictness and Nest’s DI to keep modules isolated. Introduce DTOs and validation pipes early.
4. **Run quality gates frequently** – `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run test` should pass before every commit. For deep debugging, `pnpm run start:debug` opens the inspector.
5. **Commit using conventional messages** (recommended) so CI pipelines can auto-generate changelogs later on.

### Suggested VS Code setup

- Install the **NestJS Files** and **ESLint** extensions.
- Enable format-on-save to take advantage of Prettier.
- Configure the TypeScript SDK to use the workspace version (`typescript.tsdk`).

## Testing strategy

- **Unit tests:** co-locate `.spec.ts` files with their implementation to keep context tight. Use Nest’s `TestingModule` to instantiate providers with mocked dependencies.
- **Integration/E2E tests:** `backend/test/app.e2e-spec.ts` demonstrates how to spin up the HTTP server and assert against real routes using Supertest.
- **Coverage:** `pnpm run test:cov` outputs a coverage report into `coverage/`. Aim to keep critical paths ≥80% as the project grows.
- **Node 23 test runner:** When desired, experiment with Node’s built-in test runner (`node --test`) for ultra-lightweight suites; Jest remains the default until parity is proven.

## Production build & deployment

1. **Compile:** `pnpm run build`
2. **Package artifacts:** ship the `dist/` output together with `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and production dependencies. Consider `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` in the deployment environment.
3. **Configure environment variables:** set runtime secrets (ports, database URLs, keys) via process environment.
4. **Launch:** `pnpm run start:prod`
5. **Observe:** integrate your preferred logging & metrics stack (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Prometheus) through Nest interceptors or middleware.

For containerized deployments, create a multi-stage Dockerfile that installs dependencies using `pnpm fetch`/`pnpm install --offline` during the build layer to leverage pnpm’s content-addressable store.

## Node.js v23.7.0 considerations

- **File watching:** Node 23’s stable `--watch` flag underpins Nest’s `start:dev` experience—no need for `nodemon`.
- **Permission model (experimental):** if you enable `--experimental-permission`, remember to whitelist the file system/network capabilities Nest requires.
- **Runtime flags:** 23.7 supports the `--experimental-strip-types` pipeline; this repo relies on TypeScript compiler output instead.
- **Release channel:** Node 23 is a non-LTS “Current” release. Plan to retest on the next LTS (Node 24) before promoting to mission-critical workloads.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| ------- | --- |
| `Command 'pnpm' not found` | Run `corepack enable` or install pnpm globally (`npm install -g pnpm`). |
| Node version mismatch | `nvm install 23.7.0 && nvm use 23.7.0` or `asdf install nodejs 23.7.0`. |
| TypeScript decorator metadata errors | Ensure `reflect-metadata` is imported once at the app entry point (`main.ts`). |
| Tests can’t find Nest providers | Double-check module imports in your `TestingModule` and ensure providers are registered with matching tokens. |

## Contributing & next steps

- Follow the local workflow described above and open PRs against `main`.
- Add descriptive README sections for new modules (e.g., database, messaging) as they appear.
- Automate lint/test in CI (GitHub Actions or the platform of your choice) targeting Node 23.7 first, then the latest LTS for forward-compatibility.
- Document any environment variables or secrets as soon as they’re introduced.

_Assumptions:_ at the time of writing, only the backend service exists. Whenever additional services are added, mirror this document’s structure for each component or introduce a docs/ directory with service-specific READMEs.
